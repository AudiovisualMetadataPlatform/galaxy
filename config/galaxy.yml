# Galaxy is configured by default to be usable in a single-user development
# environment.  To tune the application for a multi-user production
# environment, see the documentation at:
# 
#  https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/production.html
# 
# Throughout this sample configuration file, except where stated otherwise,
# uncommented values override the default if left unset, whereas commented
# values are set to the default value.  Relative paths are relative to the root
# Galaxy directory.
# 
# Examples of many of these options are explained in more detail in the Galaxy
# Community Hub.
