<v spk_6> um I've got kay I several different places 

621.25 --> 622.05
<v spk_6> Um 

622.64 --> 622.97
<v spk_6> and I

622.97 --> 624.98
<v spk_6> wanted to learn how to cover it up better 

624.99 --> 625.54
<v spk_6> Okay 

625.64 --> 626.31
<v spk_6> um 

626.32 --> 627.03
<v spk_6> as you can see 

627.03 --> 627.91
<v spk_6> in some spots 

627.91 --> 628.24
<v spk_6> I had

628.24 --> 629.3
<v spk_6> radiation treatment 

629.3 --> 631.04
<v spk_6> so that's kind of colored my skin 

631.38 --> 631.72
<v spk_6> which

631.72 --> 634.59
<v spk_6> is slowly turning back to its natural color 

634.59 --> 635.73
<v spk_4> But you're getting light 

635.73 --> 635.9
<v spk_4> And I

635.9 --> 636.17
<v spk_4> kind of

636.17 --> 640.79
<v spk_6> look like those little ladies on Broadway who kind of put their their rules in one spot 

640.8 --> 641.15
<v spk_6> Yeah 

641.54 --> 641.75
<v spk_6> Oh 

641.75 --> 643.05
<v spk_6> so right 

643.15 --> 645.41
<v spk_6> And wanted to learn how to blend that better 

645.58 --> 646.04
<v spk_6> Okay 

646.04 --> 646.85
<v spk_6> so what can you

646.85 --> 647.61
<v spk_4> The best thing to do

647.61 --> 649.45
<v spk_7> for that is using blush Uh-huh 

650.54 --> 651.45
<v spk_7> This might be good 

652.45 --> 655.5
<v spk_7> And it's a bought Kelly sale Blush 

655.51 --> 657.4
<v spk_7> Ahm We can use almost any makeup 

657.41 --> 660.94
<v spk_7> I make my own makeup that I've done kay 

660.94 --> 661.05
<v spk_7> Uh 

661.24 --> 666.06
<v spk_7> but it's it has the same basis of most foundations 

666.07 --> 669.6
<v spk_7> It's creamier because she can't use anything 

669.6 --> 670.15
<v spk_7> Cheer

671.44 --> 672.05
<v spk_6> Mhm 

673.24 --> 675.63
<v spk_6> So the first thing you do so cover the lesions 

675.68 --> 676.15
<v spk_7> Yeah 

677.04 --> 677.29
<v spk_7> but I

677.29 --> 677.82
<v spk_7> have to 

678.63 --> 682.93
<v spk_7> I have to make it so close enough team again 

683.39 --> 685.65
<v spk_6> What's the best way to match her skin tone 

686.73 --> 687.76
<v spk_6> How should you do it 

687.76 --> 688.1
<v spk_6> Using

688.1 --> 690.42
<v spk_6> the light tonight or trial in our

690.43 --> 690.85
<v spk_4> trial

690.85 --> 691.21
<v spk_4> and error 

691.29 --> 692.1
<v spk_4> And the best light

692.1 --> 693.4
<v spk_7> is natural light sunlight 

693.4 --> 694.05
<v spk_7> if you can 

694.66 --> 694.94
<v spk_7> Like 

694.94 --> 695.21
<v spk_6> maybe

695.21 --> 696.01
<v spk_6> put it on your hand

696.11 --> 696.8
<v spk_4> outside 

696.81 --> 698.75
<v spk_4> Most make up appears 

699.96 --> 702.38
<v spk_4> How can you look at it and say 

702.38 --> 702.54
<v spk_4> Yeah 

702.54 --> 702.97
<v spk_4> that's my

702.97 --> 703.34
<v spk_7> color

703.34 --> 705.43
<v spk_7> Then you it'll be too like uh huh 

705.52 --> 705.83
<v spk_7> All right 

705.83 --> 707.17
<v spk_7> so you just go a little darker 

707.17 --> 707.6
<v spk_7> Yeah 

707.64 --> 709.15
<v spk_7> everybody seems to go light 

709.86 --> 715.75
<v spk_7> Highlighting brings out if you shade something at recesses 

716.24 --> 724.95
<v spk_7> So a lot of chaos is raised off the show and it's like a bomb and what most guys do that they don't realize is over on it and know Bye 

725.39 --> 729.43
<v spk_7> I like make up and put it over and all it does is make it look bigger 

730.29 --> 731.53
<v spk_7> You don't want to do that right 

731.55 --> 735.75
<v spk_7> You want to take away and shaded and make it smaller if you can 

738.08 --> 741.75
<v spk_6> You're mixing two mhm 

743.34 --> 748.28
<v spk_6> Any particular brands you recommend for basis or for make out whatever works 

748.28 --> 749.45
<v spk_6> whatever is the right color 

750.33 --> 751.13
<v spk_6> So when we put on

751.21 --> 751.28
<v spk_4> it 

751.28 --> 751.44
<v spk_4> But

751.44 --> 752.65
<v spk_7> it's it's hard to get 

753.04 --> 756.15
<v spk_7> I I don't have the facility to make 

758.88 --> 759.07
<v spk_6> Yeah 

759.07 --> 759.23
<v spk_6> there

759.23 --> 762.88
<v spk_6> are make ups that have been touted as good makeups for chaos 

762.88 --> 764.69
<v spk_6> I think Derma blend 

766.61 --> 766.97
<v spk_4> Hey 

766.98 --> 768.17
<v spk_4> see what it is 

768.18 --> 768.79
<v spk_4> Okay 

769.58 --> 769.82
<v spk_4> okay 

769.82 --> 770.89
<v spk_4> Made it too heavy 

770.89 --> 772.75
<v spk_4> They they were originally designed

772.75 --> 772.87
<v spk_9> for 

772.87 --> 773.9
<v spk_9> like burn victims 

773.9 --> 774.67
<v spk_9> And the

774.67 --> 775.75
<v spk_4> problem with that 

776.71 --> 779.01
<v spk_4> there's a lot of burn victims have pick

779.01 --> 779.55
<v spk_9> skin 

780.32 --> 780.75
<v spk_9> grass

781.8 --> 783.85
<v spk_9> and the make up slides right off 

784.04 --> 789.56
<v spk_9> And that's why the German blend in those make up to so heavy and they get so cake Be looking 

789.7 --> 790.88
<v spk_4> So you're better off going

790.88 --> 795.05
<v spk_9> in and getting a good theatrical make that that they would use on stage 

796.54 --> 797.11
<v spk_9> It's good 

797.19 --> 797.71
<v spk_9> Okay 

797.91 --> 800.91
<v spk_9> so there's you go into any any department 

800.91 --> 801.11
<v spk_9> so

801.11 --> 801.34
<v spk_4> don't

801.34 --> 801.86
<v spk_4> get any look

801.86 --> 801.97
<v spk_9> would

801.97 --> 803.51
<v spk_9> make up to try to couple of days 

805.62 --> 807.78
<v spk_9> It's It's too share the

807.78 --> 808.17
<v spk_4> girls

808.18 --> 808.43
<v spk_4> who have

808.43 --> 810.3
<v spk_9> that real beautiful complexion 

810.33 --> 810.8
<v spk_9> Hm 

810.81 --> 813.22
<v spk_9> They use Okay 

813.22 --> 813.66
<v spk_9> I can

813.66 --> 814.13
<v spk_9> not use 

814.13 --> 814.76
<v spk_9> like would make 

815.0 --> 815.42
<v spk_9> Okay 

816.64 --> 819.42
<v spk_6> so it's like the old Max Factor pancake type thing 

819.66 --> 819.97
<v spk_6> Those

819.97 --> 820.25
<v spk_6> kinds

820.25 --> 820.75
<v spk_6> of things 

821.54 --> 822.16
<v spk_4> Yeah 

822.17 --> 823.76
<v spk_4> pancaked on men

823.76 --> 824.41
<v spk_7> is tough 

824.42 --> 824.74
<v spk_7> Yeah 

825.24 --> 826.18
<v spk_7> that's really mad 

826.18 --> 827.02
<v spk_7> It's really have it 

827.1 --> 827.51
<v spk_7> you know 

827.51 --> 829.07
<v spk_7> that's what's pants stick is that

829.3 --> 830.38
<v spk_4> parents think is good 

830.95 --> 831.88
<v spk_4> Can stick is good 

831.88 --> 832.57
<v spk_4> If you could find

832.57 --> 834.28
<v spk_9> a a good Max back to Penn State 

835.14 --> 835.85
<v spk_9> that'll work on 

835.85 --> 838.05
<v spk_9> That would be great and it'll last 

839.2 --> 839.97
<v spk_9> You'll have a friend 

839.97 --> 842.05
<v spk_9> That's great 

842.94 --> 843.89
<v spk_9> That would be good 

844.63 --> 845.26
<v spk_4> What kind of

845.26 --> 847.33
<v spk_6> questions of people asked you when they're in here 

847.33 --> 848.88
<v spk_6> Any other any information 

848.88 --> 849.16
<v spk_6> Here

852.91 --> 853.38
<v spk_9> we do

853.38 --> 853.98
<v spk_9> It is

854.04 --> 854.62
<v spk_9> the truth 

854.63 --> 856.64
<v spk_9> but we we speak about other problems 

856.64 --> 856.97
<v spk_9> But it's

857.19 --> 858.62
<v spk_4> what we speak about the problems

858.63 --> 859.56
<v spk_9> people have had 

859.75 --> 861.45
<v spk_9> Sure not covering 

862.74 --> 864.17
<v spk_9> That's usually the main topics 

864.17 --> 868.68
<v spk_9> Like I couldn't get a cab to take me for chemotherapy and just get on the corner 

868.68 --> 869.82
<v spk_9> and every time I raised me on 

869.82 --> 872.89
<v spk_9> they would pull over and look out and stuff and all they do 

873.74 --> 874.05
<v spk_9> you know 

874.05 --> 877.15
<v spk_9> So those kind of half of one guy last week said E 

877.84 --> 878.1
<v spk_9> I was

878.1 --> 879.26
<v spk_9> told about to shop in a

879.26 --> 880.68
<v spk_7> grocery store anymore 

880.92 --> 881.24
<v spk_7> You know 

881.24 --> 883.25
<v spk_7> a certain grocery store in his neighborhood 

883.87 --> 884.21
<v spk_7> and I

884.21 --> 885.55
<v spk_7> just get mad 

886.74 --> 887.24
<v spk_7> Sure 

887.25 --> 889.3
<v spk_7> people can be that way in this day and age 

889.45 --> 889.8
<v spk_7> you know 

889.8 --> 893.2
<v spk_7> a little bit from the old hippie generation and love generation and all that junk 

893.2 --> 895.55
<v spk_7> but probably caused all this mess to begin with 

896.44 --> 897.72
<v spk_7> Who knows what caused it 

898.11 --> 898.54
<v spk_7> You know 

898.55 --> 899.85
<v spk_7> that's not our worry now 

900.51 --> 901.96
<v spk_7> But oh 

902.75 --> 905.62
<v spk_7> you know all those people what happened to the full of a sudden 

907.11 --> 907.53
<v spk_7> you know 

907.54 --> 912.95
<v spk_7> where's the helping hand that we were all thinking about 1969 

914.59 --> 920.03
<v spk_7> So but that's that's really the main problem is people are afraid 

920.04 --> 921.79
<v spk_7> They they don't want to ride in the car 

921.79 --> 924.38
<v spk_7> They feel people are staring at them always 

925.06 --> 925.27
<v spk_4> and I

925.27 --> 925.43
<v spk_4> guess

925.43 --> 926.33
<v spk_4> that can be a problem 

926.33 --> 928.36
<v spk_4> And 11 fellow said about

928.36 --> 932.32
<v spk_8> visualization or teaching visualization in a I guess 

932.32 --> 934.05
<v spk_8> psychotherapy class or something 

934.74 --> 935.25
<v spk_8> And 

935.25 --> 935.65
<v spk_8> um 

936.49 --> 937.25
<v spk_7> he had said 

937.74 --> 938.75
<v spk_7> How can I visualized 

938.75 --> 939.55
<v spk_7> This is not here 

940.25 --> 943.05
<v spk_7> And he had 2/3 of his face with purple 

943.72 --> 944.18
<v spk_7> you know 

944.19 --> 945.15
<v spk_7> from the K s 

946.44 --> 947.95
<v spk_7> but wants to make up was on 

948.64 --> 948.95
<v spk_7> It was 

948.95 --> 949.17
<v spk_7> like 

949.17 --> 949.45
<v spk_7> a lot

949.45 --> 949.85
<v spk_7> easier 

949.85 --> 950.73
<v spk_7> He he

950.73 --> 952.82
<v spk_7> was able to get in the car and drive to the hospital 

952.82 --> 953.07
<v spk_7> And I

953.07 --> 954.98
<v spk_7> feel like everybody's standing beside the call

954.98 --> 955.45
<v spk_8> window 

955.84 --> 956.15
<v spk_8> you know 

956.15 --> 956.44
<v spk_8> So he

956.44 --> 956.61
<v spk_8> could

956.61 --> 956.85
<v spk_8> be

957.47 --> 958.89
<v spk_6> I know what that feelings like 

960.54 --> 961.87
<v spk_6> Before I had the radiation 

961.87 --> 962.2
<v spk_6> I had

962.21 --> 964.9
<v spk_6> very dark lesions here 

964.91 --> 965.48
<v spk_6> here 

965.63 --> 966.17
<v spk_6> here 

966.28 --> 966.85
<v spk_6> here 

968.34 --> 968.87
<v spk_4> And it is

968.87 --> 969.39
<v spk_6> rough

969.49 --> 969.98
<v spk_6> You know 

970.02 --> 970.65
<v spk_6> um 

971.81 --> 975.39

<v spk_6> if you don't have to concentrate on dry loss and things 

995.24 --> 996.07
<v spk_6> And of course 

996.07 --> 996.71
<v spk_6> as you're doing that 

996.71 --> 1001.96
<v spk_6> you're looking at your body and you're seeing all the new spots and seeing what's happening 

1002.39 --> 1003.26
<v spk_6> Um 

1004.07 --> 1004.72
<v spk_6> and that to me 

1004.72 --> 1005.96
<v spk_6> is the rough period 

1006.9 --> 1009.35
<v spk_7> What was the hardest part about going out to get make them 

1011.1 --> 1011.28
<v spk_7> It

1011.28 --> 1012.37
<v spk_6> was never hard for me 

1012.4 --> 1012.66
<v spk_6> You know 

1013.45 --> 1016.21
<v spk_6> I always I always had make up 

1016.22 --> 1018.28
<v spk_6> so that wasn't a problem 

1018.29 --> 1021.15
<v spk_6> It's just learning now to do something different with it 

1021.74 --> 1022.26
<v spk_6> Yeah 

1025.53 --> 1029.26
<v spk_6> I never really did a full face of makeup unless it was 

1029.27 --> 1029.55
<v spk_6> you know 

1029.55 --> 1031.2
<v spk_6> part of your Exactly 

1031.32 --> 1033.14
<v spk_6> And then I wasn't trying to cover something 

1033.14 --> 1033.32
<v spk_6> I was

1033.32 --> 1036.85
<v spk_6> just kind of creating an illusion 

1037.94 --> 1038.12
<v spk_6> So

1038.12 --> 1038.96
<v spk_4> how did you start doing

1038.96 --> 1039.12
<v spk_6> this 

1039.12 --> 1039.41
<v spk_6> What 

1039.42 --> 1041.84
<v spk_6> What made you start doing make up for cash

1042.33 --> 1042.85
<v spk_4> doing

1043.77 --> 1045.09
<v spk_4> I took a special costs

1045.09 --> 1046.66
<v spk_3> in California for 

1046.66 --> 1046.91
<v spk_3> um 

1046.92 --> 1048.24
<v spk_3> special effects makeup 

1048.35 --> 1048.94
<v spk_3> Hm 

1049.27 --> 1049.56
<v spk_3> And I

1049.56 --> 1058.26
<v spk_3> was learning how to do nuclear burns with Jello in a class When I started to think about little kids that had 

1059.54 --> 1060.09
<v spk_3> um 

1060.1 --> 1061.38
<v spk_3> strawberries and 

1062.14 --> 1062.45
<v spk_3> you know 

1062.45 --> 1062.91
<v spk_3> burns

1062.91 --> 1064.16
<v spk_3> and different colors 

1065.24 --> 1067.55
<v spk_3> And then I took an actress friend of mine to a party 

1068.14 --> 1070.85
<v spk_3> and they were all doctors talking 

1070.86 --> 1072.05
<v spk_3> They thought I was an actress 

1073.04 --> 1073.34
<v spk_3> and I

1073.34 --> 1078.35
<v spk_3> said no to make a farthest and taking special courses 

1080.24 --> 1083.45
<v spk_3> And they invited me to UCLA to the K s clinic 

1083.45 --> 1084.76
<v spk_3> I didn't know what case was 

1086.44 --> 1087.2
<v spk_3> So when I got there 

1087.2 --> 1087.91
<v spk_3> they showed me and

1087.91 --> 1088.27
<v spk_5> books

1088.27 --> 1091.85
<v spk_5> what it looks like and asked me if I can make something to help them 

1092.59 --> 1093.83
<v spk_5> because psychologically 

1093.83 --> 1094.19
<v spk_5> was it 

1094.55 --> 1094.84
<v spk_5> Yeah 

1095.13 --> 1096.19
<v spk_5> it's a real pain 

1097.2 --> 1097.55
<v spk_5> Yep 

1098.0 --> 1098.66
<v spk_5> So many words 

1098.66 --> 1100.62
<v spk_5> The list and I I said Sure 

1100.63 --> 1101.0
<v spk_5> Okay 

1101.22 --> 1101.68
<v spk_5> You know 

1101.69 --> 1102.03
<v spk_5> I can

1102.03 --> 1102.55
<v spk_5> tell her that 

1103.74 --> 1104.14
<v spk_5> And I

1104.14 --> 1105.19
<v spk_5> made it in a week later 

1105.19 --> 1107.73
<v spk_5> I came back and 

1107.73 --> 1107.95
<v spk_5> uh 

1107.96 --> 1108.94
<v spk_5> we used it at work 

1108.95 --> 1109.35
<v spk_5> Great

1110.04 --> 1110.21
<v spk_5> And I

1110.21 --> 1111.54
<v spk_5> was running all of Los

1111.54 --> 1116.88
<v spk_3> Angeles distributing make a and going broke 

1116.88 --> 1119.05
<v spk_3> So I had to come back to New York to go to work 

1120.14 --> 1123.88
<v spk_3> to make money so I could make more make up and keep running around giving it 

1124.01 --> 1124.47
<v spk_3> you know 

1124.84 --> 1126.49
<v spk_3> teaching everybody how to use it 

1126.58 --> 1127.4
<v spk_6> You lose contact 

1127.4 --> 1129.52
<v spk_6> crayon your black people for chaos 

1129.63 --> 1131.22
<v spk_6> How did you make tough 

1131.22 --> 1132.34
<v spk_6> Incredible Discover 

1132.34 --> 1133.94
<v spk_4> I went to someone's

1133.94 --> 1138.82
<v spk_7> apartment who had k s one night not realizing he's a black man until I got to the neighborhood and they said 

1138.82 --> 1138.87
<v spk_7> Oh

<v spk_7> my God 

1139.47 --> 1140.35
<v spk_7> he may be blast 

1140.44 --> 1141.31
<v spk_7> What do I do 

1141.89 --> 1142.24
<v spk_7> And I

1142.24 --> 1144.97
<v spk_7> have a few dog colors in my makeup case 

1144.97 --> 1145.1
<v spk_7> But

1145.1 --> 1146.03
<v spk_4> I didn't have everything

1146.03 --> 1149.38
<v spk_7> with me usually cavities and some pleasures 

1149.38 --> 1155.95
<v spk_7> And and I would run around because I couldn't carry this everywhere I would in the microwave and all the other stuff 

1156.64 --> 1157.66
<v spk_7> and he was an artist 

1158.24 --> 1165.38
<v spk_7> And he's just sitting on a on a What do you call me so and

1165.38 --> 1165.98
<v spk_4> so on

1166.3 --> 1166.92
<v spk_4> people

<v spk_4> If you ever notice

1168.1 --> 1169.76
<v spk_7> when they get cut or scratch 

1170.34 --> 1177.74
<v spk_7> Fishkin gets black or so they hyper pigment when they hear what you have to do is make that lighter 

1177.75 --> 1179.35
<v spk_7> Hm and then talking it again 

1180.24 --> 1183.42
<v spk_7> So it's it's perfect sense you don't

1183.43 --> 1183.95
<v spk_4> do that 

1185.12 --> 1185.56
<v spk_4> So we

1185.56 --> 1185.81
<v spk_4> found

1185.81 --> 1187.17
<v spk_4> that the light of one

1187.17 --> 1188.44
<v spk_7> of these to work great

<v spk_7> and I

1198.14 --> 1199.85
<v spk_7> started going over it like that 

1201.22 --> 1203.45
<v spk_7> and it wasn't writing perfect with his skin 

1204.64 --> 1205.59
<v spk_7> And he was thrilled 

1205.6 --> 1209.45
<v spk_7> He had his own set of constant God 

1209.45 --> 1210.71
<v spk_7> I can't go anywhere without time

<v spk_7> well 

1218.14 --> 1218.44

1249.55 --> 1251.41
<v spk_5> skin problems that nobody knew about 

1251.42 --> 1253.76

1265.76 --> 1266.65
<v spk_5> burn people 

1266.65 --> 1272.55
<v spk_5> I didn't know that there was trouble of for people who have been badly burned in auto accidents or other place 

1273.77 --> 1274.35
<v spk_5> Um 

1275.0 --> 1277.58
<v spk_5> there's just been those support group for any of them 

1278.64 --> 1279.21
<v spk_5> you know 

1279.22 --> 1283.74
<v spk_5> and because of AIDS and because of people with AIDS Coalition at G 

1283.74 --> 1283.9
<v spk_5> M 

1283.9 --> 1284.05
<v spk_5> A 

1284.06 --> 1284.5
<v spk_5> C 

1284.51 --> 1284.81
<v spk_5> It is

1284.81 --> 1286.05
<v spk_5> getting out finally 

1287.0 --> 1289.73
<v spk_4> and it's helping all these other areas indirectly 

1289.73 --> 1291.15
<v spk_5> but very directly for 

1291.5 --> 1291.87
<v spk_5> you know 

1291.87 --> 1292.74
<v spk_4> so people 

1292.75 --> 1293.32
<v spk_4> People look

1293.32 --> 1293.53
<v spk_6> at it

1293.53 --> 1294.07
<v spk_6> and they figure 

1294.07 --> 1294.25
<v spk_6> oh 

1294.25 --> 1294.47
<v spk_6> well 

1294.47 --> 1295.43
<v spk_6> you're healthy 

1295.56 --> 1296.12
<v spk_6> um 

1296.12 --> 1296.34
<v spk_6> or 

1296.34 --> 1296.54
<v spk_6> you know 

1296.54 --> 1297.45
<v spk_6> it's just your skin 

1297.45 --> 1298.55
<v spk_6> That shouldn't matter 

1299.08 --> 1300.25
<v spk_6> But that's not true 

1300.34 --> 1300.82
<v spk_6> Um 

1300.83 --> 1306.17
<v spk_6> how you feel about yourself is very important to your wellness and your well being 

1306.17 --> 1306.8
<v spk_6> And how

1307.24 --> 1308.6
<v spk_4> is 90%

1308.61 --> 1312.2
<v spk_5> of your entire body made a scan 

1312.2 --> 1312.54
<v spk_5> It is

1312.68 --> 1317.45
<v spk_5> the largest Oregon of your entire body is your skin 

1318.4 --> 1320.7
<v spk_6> But what we're doing today is just cosmetic 

1320.7 --> 1320.79
<v spk_6> We're

1320.79 --> 1321.91
<v spk_6> not hearing it 

1321.91 --> 1323.45
<v spk_6> but it But we're helping other 

1324.22 --> 1326.25
<v spk_4> How you feel about not caring it 

1326.26 --> 1329.11
<v spk_4> Because since we can make it on the side of visualization 

1329.11 --> 1330.26
<v spk_5> what makes you feel better 

1331.4 --> 1331.59
<v spk_5> You

1331.59 --> 1331.67
<v spk_4> know 

1331.67 --> 1333.07
<v spk_4> I'm sure if somebody on TV

1333.07 --> 1336.04
<v spk_5> didn't shake the federal Dustin and say 

1336.34 --> 1339.92
<v spk_5> Take Kalaris because when you see just you're going to sneeze 

1339.92 --> 1341.5
<v spk_5> half the world wouldn't be sneezing 

1341.5 --> 1342.29
<v spk_5> But before that 

1342.29 --> 1343.91
<v spk_5> television is shaking that dust 

1343.91 --> 1345.16
<v spk_5> Everybody's sneezing 

1345.17 --> 1350.45
<v spk_5> So I think psychologically it has a a lot to do with all of it 

1355.87 --> 1358.83
<v spk_9> One of you six 

1358.83 --> 1359.59
<v spk_9> I'm going to go with the

1362.18 --> 1363.5
<v spk_4> just for around with your V

1363.5 --> 1368.85
<v spk_7> online it seeing that you're in two and make a you know

1368.85 --> 1369.05
<v spk_6> Oh 

1369.05 --> 1370.23
<v spk_6> I I don't mind this 

1370.23 --> 1371.05
<v spk_6> This would be fun 

1372.44 --> 1374.2
<v spk_6> The darker powder down below 

1374.5 --> 1374.74
<v spk_4> Yeah 

1374.74 --> 1375.21
<v spk_4> I would use

1375.21 --> 1375.65
<v spk_7> it to

1375.96 --> 1376.45
<v spk_7> go on

1377.07 --> 1377.92
<v spk_7> It might be a line 

1377.92 --> 1380.05
<v spk_7> It's just only common sense that sure 

1380.54 --> 1380.96
<v spk_7> a man

1380.96 --> 1381.11
<v spk_7> would

1381.11 --> 1382.55
<v spk_7> be doctor in that area 

1385.45 --> 1385.6
<v spk_7> It'll

1385.6 --> 1385.79
<v spk_7> help 

1385.79 --> 1386.5
<v spk_7> Give me cheek 

1387.71 --> 1391.04
<v spk_7> Did they just concentrate the radiation on each 

1391.75 --> 1392.0
<v spk_6> Yeah 

1392.0 --> 1394.66
<v spk_6> it's It's a very localized thing 

1395.07 --> 1395.7
<v spk_6> Um 

1395.71 --> 1396.76
<v spk_6> and they had 

1397.14 --> 1397.45
<v spk_6> I had

1397.45 --> 1398.44
<v spk_6> five spots 

1398.79 --> 1400.02
<v spk_6> Five areas hit 

1400.37 --> 1400.83
<v spk_6> Um 

1400.84 --> 1402.69
<v spk_6> sometimes they were able to hit more than one 

1402.69 --> 1404.14
<v spk_6> Location says it hurt 

1404.3 --> 1404.64
<v spk_6> Not a

1404.64 --> 1404.88
<v spk_6> bit 

1404.89 --> 1406.37
<v spk_6> You don't feel a thing 

1406.76 --> 1407.53
<v spk_6> Um 

1407.54 --> 1409.53
<v spk_6> I would be in and out if they were ready for me 

1409.53 --> 1412.05
<v spk_6> I I was in and out of radiation room in 10 minutes 

1413.02 --> 1414.01
<v spk_6> That's another thing so much 

1414.01 --> 1415.48
<v spk_6> You have a very good life surrounds 

1415.76 --> 1416.6
<v spk_4> See what they're doing 

1420.94 --> 1421.56
<v spk_4> But daylight

1421.56 --> 1422.06
<v spk_5> is is

1422.06 --> 1424.54
<v spk_5> the best because it's light 

1424.54 --> 1426.97
<v spk_5> Calvin Sunlight is 

1426.98 --> 1429.53
<v spk_5> I don't know about 5000 like have Calvin's 

1429.53 --> 1430.95
<v spk_5> Calvin's is measure of life 

1432.24 --> 1432.87
<v spk_5> I think some 

1432.87 --> 1441.49
<v spk_5> like somewhere like 11,000 a regular television studio that we working would be maybe 3500 like Calvin 

1441.65 --> 1443.02
<v spk_5> So it's a softer light 

1443.44 --> 1443.74
<v spk_5> So if

1443.74 --> 1444.34
<v spk_4> you put making

1444.34 --> 1450.6
<v spk_5> fun and 5000 Calvin lighting and very Bryce when you bring them into a software like to make 

1450.6 --> 1451.67
<v spk_5> it looks even nicer 

1452.28 --> 1452.58
<v spk_5> So if

1452.58 --> 1457.95
<v spk_5> you could do with and the more natural surrounding of light 

1459.0 --> 1460.43
<v spk_5> the results will be much better 

1460.47 --> 1461.28
<v spk_6> A more realistic 

1461.28 --> 1462.45
<v spk_6> It looks under bright light 

1462.45 --> 1464.01
<v spk_6> the better look under softer

1467.38 --> 1470.78
<v spk_5> like light near islands a little bit 

1471.23 --> 1471.48
<v spk_5> So

1471.48 --> 1472.45
<v spk_6> they match 

1473.68 --> 1474.57
<v spk_6> That's a good point 

1474.61 --> 1475.05
<v spk_6> Sure

1475.05 --> 1475.83
<v spk_4> when it balance 

1475.84 --> 1476.21
<v spk_6> Sure 

1476.21 --> 1478.34
<v spk_6> So even though this doesn't have allusion on it 

1478.34 --> 1479.6
<v spk_6> I should put on the same thing 

1479.6 --> 1479.85
<v spk_6> So it

1479.85 --> 1480.35
<v spk_6> matches 

1481.54 --> 1482.34
<v spk_6> That's great 

1483.3 --> 1483.79
<v spk_6> Yeah 

1490.94 --> 1491.26
<v spk_6> Hm 

1506.44 --> 1506.9
<v spk_6> Great

1506.98 --> 1507.29
<v spk_6> Thank

1507.29 --> 1507.6
<v spk_6> you very

1507.6 --> 1507.84
<v spk_4> much 

1507.85 --> 1509.05
<v spk_4> You're welcome very much
